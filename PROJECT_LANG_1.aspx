<!-- Project language file 1
For: /SNU/2D/ProgrammingTols/IDE/ASP.NET/
About:
I decided to make ASP.NET (Action Server Pages DOT NET) the main project language file for this project (SNU / 2D / Programming Tools / IDE / ASP.NET) as this is a ASP.NET IDE, and it needs its main language to be represented here.
